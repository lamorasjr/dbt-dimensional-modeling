# Dimensional Data Modeling with dbt

This repository is designed for practicing dimensional data modeling concepts using dbt.

The content and instructions for this project were adapted from the following article and repository:
* [Article: Building a Kimball dimensional model with dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/kimball-dimensional-model)
* [Github Repo: dbt-dimensional-modelling](https://github.com/Data-Engineer-Camp/dbt-dimensional-modelling/tree/main)
