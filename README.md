# Dimensional Data Modeling with dbt

This repository is designed for practicing dimensional data modeling concepts using dbt.

The content and instructions for this project were adapted from the following article and repository:
* [Article: Building a Kimball dimensional model with dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/kimball-dimensional-model)
* [Github Repo: dbt-dimensional-modelling](https://github.com/Data-Engineer-Camp/dbt-dimensional-modelling/tree/main)

## Content & Progress Tracking

- [x] Step 1 - Set up a mock dbt project and database
- [x] Step 2 - Identify the business process to model
- [x] Step 3 - Identify the fact and dimension tables
- [x] Step 4 - Create the dimension tables
- [ ] Step 5 - Create the fact table
- [ ] Step 6 - Document the dimensional model relationships
- [ ] Step 7 - Consume the dimensional model

### Using the starter project
